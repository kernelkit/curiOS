# curiOS â€” a slim curated container OS

curiOS, pronounced curious, is a project by the [same team][8] of developers
that created and maintain the [Infix operating system][7].  If you like the
idea of modeling an entire OS with YANG, have a look at Infix.

This project provides a set of *defconfigs* for 64-bit ARM and x86 systems
that can be used with Infix or any other [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/)
compatible runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The system container is very useful for staging/development before deploying
> any of the slim application containers, because they can be very difficult
> to debug (none or little tooling in image).


## AppStore

The [KernelKit AppStore][2] on GHCR provides the following pre-built images.

### [curiOS system][3]

A system container, example of how to run multiple services.  Comes with the
following services and tools:

 - Dropbear SSH daemon
 - mini-snmpd
 - netopeer-cli
 - nftables
 - ntpd

### [curiOS ntpd][4]

ISC ntpd supports [multicasting NTP][10] to a subnet.

### [curiOS nftables][5]

Useful for advanced netfilter setups when the container runs in host network
mode.  At startup it loads `/etc/nftables.conf` and then waits for a signal.
At shutdown `nft flush ruleset` is called.

This container comes with a minimal set of BusyBox tools, including a shell,
so the `nftables.conf` file can be modified from inside the container (vi).
Although the most common use-case is to mount a file from the host system.

### [curiOS httpd][6]

Tiny web server container based on BusyBox httpd, suitable for embedding in a
firmware image as an example container.


## Origin & References

curiOS is a wrapper around [Buildroot][0] for creating container images for
uploading to Docker Hub or similar.  Buildroot is an SDK for building embedded
Linux distributions.  It handles the removal of man pages, shared files, and
many pieces not germane to running on an embedded platform, and, as it turns
out, containers.

curiOS is a fork of https://github.com/brianredbeard/coreos_buildroot
